In 1999, she moved on to Oâ€™Reilly Media, where she held the position of Product Manager, Senior Marketing Manager, and Partner Manager for the next 16 years.
                At this point, she felt it was time to give back to the open source community that had been so welcoming to her by transitioning to The Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit membership organization, where she spent the next 6 years as Sponsorship Coordinator and Administrator. <br>
                In May of 2021, she returned to the broader open source community by joining the Open Source Initiative as the Director of Sustainability. She is conducting research and market segmentation, creating sales, drawing connections, identifying opportunities and gaps as well as developing and overseeing OSI annual fundraising initiatives and programs.

<h4 class="mb-3">To promote and protect open source software and communities...</h4>

<p class="mb-2" style="font-size:14px;">
  For over 20 years the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has worked to raise awareness and adoption of open source software, and build bridges between open source communities of practice. As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
  Open source software is made by many people and distributed under an OSD-compliant license which grants all the rights to use, study, change, and share the software in modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open source software.
